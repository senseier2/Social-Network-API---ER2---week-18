## Description
    The Social Media API is an back-end API for a social media platform allowing for user interaction based on posting thoughts, and reactions.  This model can be used for multiple types of social experiences.

## Installation
    Download the repository, install your dependencies by typing "npm i" and start the API by typing "npm start" in your terminal.   You can use Postman to test the routes.

## Usage
    You can use this project to build a social media platform, or to test social interactions. Unfortunately I found that my reactions are not working so you will not be able to use the Reaction routes until I can find the bugs and squish them.   Thank you in advance for looking at this API!

## Test Instructions
    The testing instructions are the same as the installation instructions, as testing involves. Installing the repository, running npm i for dependencies, starting the application with npm start, and finally using postman to test the routes.
